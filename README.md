# SnakeGame
Snake game created with Processing

This was my very first project with Processing. 
This game was made in 2016 during my first semester of Computer science in Maynooth University. 
For the project we had to make a game of some sort within a week. 

I was initially quite happy with this code as it was my first ever real programming project,
however, looking back on it now there are so many improvements I could have made to it.

Things I would improve/change:

1.Make it more visually pleasing as it is very basic to look at.

2.Add different sound/visual effects for collecting items or dying in the game.

3.Add an options menu and different difficulty menu.
